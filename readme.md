# Tactical Command
is a game made back in 2014 while I was in college. Tactical command is a
rendition of the classic game, battleship, but in space. All the coding and
artwork was done by myself, a feat I was quite proud of back in the day. It's
not polished by any stretch of the imagination, but what else can you expect
from a student?

## Features
For how unpolished this game is, it has a few typical scenes you would expect,
such as a:

##### splash screen

## Try it out?
You're welcome to try it out, if you would like. It requires the
[SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) C++ library >= 2.1 (It was developed with
2.1, but it's been tested with 2.3.2 as well).

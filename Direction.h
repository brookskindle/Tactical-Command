/* An enumeration that identifies valid directions that ships can be placed
on the board. Directions can be combined using the bitwise or operator.
For Example:
    North | East would be equivalent of saying the direction is NorthEast
    East | West does nothing at all (EastWest doesn't many any sense, does it?)
    SouthWest | West is equivalent to saying SouthWest
    SouthEast is equivalent to South | East
